# Usage

This library provides a way to describe rules and create a tokenizer.

Let's consider the input string that contains lowercase-alpha strings and unsigned integers separated by a semicolon:

```
foo;123;bar;456
```

First we need to describe [readers](#readers) that would read chars from the input string.

To read a lowercase-alpha string we would use the following reader:

```ts
import {all, char} from 'tokenizer-dsl';

const alphaReader = all(char([['a', 'z']]), {minimumCount: 1});
```

The reader works exactly as the regular expression `/[a-z]+/y`.

To read a number we need a more complex reader.

```ts
import {all, char, or, seq, text} from 'tokenizer-dsl';

const integerReader = or(
    text('0'),
    seq(
        char([['1', '9']]),
        all(char([['0', '9']]))
    )
);
```

The reader above would read a single "0" char or any char from "1" to "9" followed by a digit char. This reader works
the same way as `/0|[1-9]\d*/y`.

To read a semicolon char we would use this simple reader:

```ts
import {text} from 'tokenizer-dsl';

const semicolonReader = text(';');
```

Now when we defined all required readers, we can define the [tokenization rules](#rules):

```ts
import {Rule} from 'tokenizer-dsl';

const alphaRule: Rule = {
  type: 'ALPHA',
  reader: alphaReader,
};

const integerRule: Rule = {
  type: 'INTEGER',
  reader: integerReader,
};

const semicolonRule: Rule = {
  type: 'SEMICOLON',
  reader: semicolonReader,
};
```

`type` is the name of the token that this rule would read from the input string.

`reader` is the reader that actually reads the chars from the string.

The next step is to create a tokenizer and provide it a set of rules:

```ts
const tokenize = createTokenizer([
  alphaRule,
  integerRule,
  semicolonRule
]);
```

`createTokenizer` would compile a highly efficient function that applies rules to read chars from the string.

As the last step, we should call a tokenizer and provide it an input and a token handler:

```ts
import {TokenHandler} from 'tokenizer-dsl';

const handler: TokenHandler = {

  token(type, offset, length) {
    console.log(type, input.substr(offset, length), 'at', offset);
  }
};

tokenize('foo;123;bar;456', handler);
```

The console output would be:

```
ALPHA foo at 0
SEMICOLON ; at 3
INTEGER 123 at 4
SEMICOLON ; at 7
ALPHA bar at 8
SEMICOLON ; at 11
INTEGER 456 at 12
```

To capture unrecognized tokens you can add an `unrecognizedToken` callback to the handler:

```ts
const handler: TokenHandler = {

  token(type, offset, length) {
    console.log(type, input.substr(offset, length), 'at', offset);
  },

  unrecognizedToken(offset) {
    console.log('Unrecognized token at', offset);
  }
};
```

Let's test it with a malformed input. Notice the "_" char that isn't recognized by tokenization rules that we defined:

```ts
tokenize('abc_', handler);
```

The console output would be:

```
ALPHA abc at 0
Unrecognized token at 4
```

# Readers

To read characters from the input string, this library uses a concept of readers. A reader can be defined as
a [function](#functional-readers) or as a [code-generating factory](#code-generated-readers).

Most of the time you won't need to write your own readers and since you can use a rich set of built-in reader factories.

## Built-in readers

### `text(string, options?)`

Reads the case-sensitive substring from the input:

```ts
// Reads "foo"
const fooReader = text('foo');
```

You can optionally specify that text must be case-insensitive:

```ts
// Reads "bar", "BAR", "Bar", etc.
const barReader = text('bar', {caseInsensitive: true});
```

### `char(chars)`

Reads a single char from the string. You should provide an array of strings, char codes or char ranges.

```ts
// Reads "a", "b", or "c"
const abReader = char(['a', 98, 99]);
```

You can specify a set of characters as a string with multiple characters:

```ts
// Reads " ", "\t", "\r", or "\n"
const whitespaceReader = char([' \t\r\n']);
```

You can specify a pair of char codes or strings that denote a char range:

```ts
// Reads [a-zA-Z]
const alphaReader = char([['a', 'z'], [65, 90]]);
```

### `regex(pattern)`

Reads substring using the `RegExp` pattern:

```ts
// Reads "0", "123", etc.
const integerReader = regex(/0|[1-9]\d*/);
```

You don't need to specify `g` or `y` flags on the `RegExp`, these flags are automatically added if needed.

### `all(reader, options?)`

Applies `reader` until it can read from the input:

```ts
// Reads "abc" from "abc123"
const lowerAlphaReader = all(char([['a', 'z']]));
```

You can optionally specify the number of entries the `reader` must read to consider success:

```ts
// Reads at least one digit, but not more than 10
const digitsReader = all(char([['0', '9']]), {minimumCount: 1, maximumCount: 10});
```

### `seq(...readers)`

Describes a sequence of readers that must be applied one after another:

```ts
// Reads PK-XXXXX where X is a digit
const pkReader = seq(
    text('PK-'),
    all(char([['0', '9']]), {minimumCount: 5, maximumCount: 5})
);
```

### `or(...readers)`

Returns the offset returned by the first successfully applied reader:

```ts
// Reads "foo" or "bar"
const fooOrBarReader = or(
    text('foo'),
    text('bar')
);
```

### `skip(count)`

Skips the given number of chars:

```ts
// Reads 5 arbitrary chars 
const skip5Reader = skip(5);
```

### `until(reader, options?)`

Reads until the `reader` is successfully reads chars from the string. If `reader` failed to read chars in the input
then `until` returns `NO_MATCH`.

```ts
// Reads everything until "foo" exclusively
const untilFooReader = until(text('foo'));
```

You can make until to read inclusively:

```ts
// Reads everything until "bar" inclusvely
const untilBarReader = until(text('bar'), {inclusive: true});
```

For example, to read all chars up to ">" or until the end of the input:

````ts
const untilGtReader = or(
    until(text('>'), {inclusive: true}),
    end()
);
````

### `end(offset?)`

Reads all character until the end of the input. You can optionally provide the offset from the input end.

```ts
const upToLastCharReader = end(-1);
```

### `lookahead(reader)`

This is the same as [lookahead from the regular expressions](https://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html). It
returns the current offset if `reader` successfully reads chars from the input at current offset.

```ts
// Reads "<" from "<a"
const startTagReader = seq(
    text('<'),
    lookahead(char([['a', 'z']]))
)
```

### `maybe(reader)`

Returns the current offset if the `reader` failed to read chars:

```ts
// Reads "foo-bar" and "bar"
const fooBarReader = seq(
    maybe(text('foo-')),
    text('bar')
)
```

### `never`

The singleton reader that always returns `NO_MATCH`.

### `none`

The singleton reader that always returns the current offset.

## Functional readers

A reader can be defined as a function that takes an `input` string, an `offset` at which it should start reading, and a
`context`. A reader should return a new offset in the `input` (a non-negative integer) or a result code (a negative
integer). Learn more about the context in the [Context](#context) section.

This library defines only one result code `NO_MATCH` with value -1. When the reader returns this code it signals the
tokenizer that it tries to read chars from the input string, but they didn't meet the expectation.

Let's create a custom reader:

```ts
import {Reader, NO_MATCH} from 'tokenizer-dsl';

const fooReader: Reader = (input, offset, context) => {
  return input.startsWith('foo', offset) ? offset + 4 : NO_MATCH;
};
```

This reader checks that the `input` string contains a substring "foo" at the `offset` and returns the new offset where
the substring ends. Or returns a `NO_MATCH` result code indicating that the expectation wasn't met.

We can use `fooReader` reader along with any other readers. For example, to read chars until "foo" is met:

```ts
import {until} from 'tokenizer-dsl';

const untilFooReader = until(fooReader);
```

## Code-generated readers

This library relies on code generation to create a highly performant readers. To leverage this feature, you can define
your custom readers as a code factories.

Let's recreate the reader from the previous section with the codegen approach:

```ts
import {Reader, NO_MATCH} from 'tokenizer-dsl';

const fooReader: Reader = {

  factory(inputVar, offsetVar, contextVar, resultVar) {
    return {
      code: [
        resultVar, '=', inputVar, '.startsWith("foo",', offsetVar, ')?', offsetVar, '+1:', NO_MATCH, ';',
      ]
    };
  }
}
```

The `factory` function receives four input arguments that define the variables that should be used in the output code
template:

- `inputVar` is the variable that holds the input string.
- `offsetVar` is the variable that holds the offset in the input string from which the reader must be applied.
- `contextVar` is the variable that holds the reader context. Learn more about the context in the [Context](#context)
  section.
- `resultVar` is the variable to which the reader result must be assigned.

The `factory` function should return an object containing a `code` property that holds the code template and an optional
`bindings` property that holds the variable bindings.

To demonstrate how to use bindings, let's enhance our reader to support arbitrary strings:

```ts
import {Reader, NO_MATCH} from 'tokenizer-dsl';

function substring(str: string): Reader {
  return {

    factory(inputVar, offsetVar, contextVar, resultVar) {

      // Create a variable placeholder
      const strVar = Symbol();

      return {
        code: [
          resultVar, '=', inputVar, '.startsWith(', strVar, ',', offsetVar, ')?', offsetVar, '+1:', NO_MATCH, ';',
        ],
        bindings: [
          // Assign str to a strVar at runtime
          [strVar, str]
        ]
      };
    }
  };
}
```

We can use `substring` reader along with any other readers. For example, to read all sequential substrings in the input:

```ts
import {all} from 'tokenizer-dsl';

const allFooReader = all(substring('foo'));
```

You can introduce custom variables inside a code template. Below is an example of a reader that reads lower all alpha
chars from the string using a `for` loop:

```ts
import {Reader, NO_MATCH} from 'tokenizer-dsl';

const lowerAlphaReader: Reader = {

  factory(inputVar, offsetVar, contextVar, resultVar) {

    // Create a variable placeholders
    const indexVar = Symbol();
    const charCodeVar = Symbol();

    return {
      code: [

        // Start reading from the offset
        'var ', indexVar, '=', offsetVar, ';',

        // Read until end of the input
        'while(', indexVar, '<', inputVar, '.length){',

        // Read the char code from the input
        'var ', charCodeVar, '=', indexVar, '.charCodeAt(', indexVar, ');',

        // Abort the loop if the char code isn't a lower alpha
        'if(', charCodeVar, '<97||', charCodeVar, '>122)break;',

        // Otherwise, proceed to the next char
        indexVar, '++',
        '}',

        // Return the index that was reached 
        resultVar, '=', indexVar, ';',
      ]
    };
  }
};
```

# Performance

Tokenizer performance comes from following implementation aspects

- reader combination optimizations
- All readers (except regex()) rely only on charCodeAt, indexOf. This dramatically reduces memory allocations, since no
  substrings or other objects are created.
- Tokenizer compiles all rules into a single function. No call stack overhead.
- Rules that share the same prefix sequence of readers do read prefix from the input only once. Chars in the string are
  accessed less frequently.

For example until(text('foo')) would read case-sensitive characters from the sting until substring "foo" is met. A regex
analog of this is input.match(/^.*?(?=foo)/). But on the other hand, this is the same as input.indexOf('foo') which is
10x faster.

Tokenizer uses rules to read tokens from the input. Rules use readers that read characters from the string.

Example below shows how to assemble readers to create tokenizer for numbers:

```ts
import {all, char, maybe, text, or, seq} from 'tokenizer-dsl';

const readZero = text('0');

const readLeadingDigit = char((charCode) => charCode >= 49 /*1*/ && charCode <= 57 /*9*/);

const readDigits = all(char((charCode) => charCode >= 48 /*0*/ && charCode <= 57 /*9*/));

const readDot = text('.');

const readSign = char((charCode) => charCode === 43 /*+*/ || charCode === 45 /*-*/);

const readNumber = seq(
    // sign
    maybe(readSign),

    // integer
    or(
        readZero,
        seq(
            readLeadingDigit,
            readDigits,
        ),
    ),

    // fraction
    maybe(
        seq(
            readDot,
            maybe(readDigits),
        ),
    ),
);
```

To get the offset at which the number ends in the string call `readNumber` and provide an `input` string, and
an `offset` from which the reading should be started:

```ts
readNumber(/*input*/ '0', /*offset*/ 0); // â†’ 1

readNumber(/*input*/ '123', /*offset*/ 0); // â†’ 3

readNumber(/*input*/ '+123', /*offset*/ 0); // â†’ 4

readNumber(/*input*/ '-0.123', /*offset*/ 0); // â†’ 6

readNumber(/*input*/ '-123.123', /*offset*/ 0); // â†’ 8

readNumber(/*input*/ 'aaa123bbb', /*offset*/ 3);
// â†’ 6, because valid number starts at offset 3 and ends at 6
```

If `input` string doesn't contain a valid number at an `offset` then `NO_MATCH === -1` is returned:

```ts
readNumber(/*input*/ 'aaa', /*offset*/ 0); // â†’ -1

readNumber(/*input*/ 'a123', /*offset*/ 0); // â†’ -1

readNumber(/*input*/ '0000', /*offset*/ 0);
// â†’ 1, because valid number starts at 0 and ends at 1 
```
